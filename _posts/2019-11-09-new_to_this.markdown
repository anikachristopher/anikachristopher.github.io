In the olden days, just the site of a coffee cup would have me awake for a week. I kept insisting though that I should try to become a "coffee drinker" so I'd buy weaker coffee drinks mostly from Mc Donald's. I would get through half of a small drink and immediately feel nauseated which I attributed to the caffeine. Not actually sure. 

Enter Flatiron pre-work. Long days and even longer nights. I now drink one of every coffee related item on Mc Donald's menu on a DAILY basis. It's actually too weak for me already so I have to find stronger stuff. Dunkin' Donuts will be next for sure.

Maybe before I just wasn't tired to begin with. 

This coding journey has brought me a lot of other new practices, all of which I embrace. I am determined to make this change and I'm willing to put in the work.
