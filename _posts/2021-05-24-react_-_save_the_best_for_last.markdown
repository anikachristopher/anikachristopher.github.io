Components...Props...State....all the things that will ensure you're never late!

React is by far the fastest tech I've learned and I had a great time learning it. I navigate the world with new eyes, seeing everything through the lens of a component, functioning independently but also as part of a whole, bigger and more beautiful story.

Components let you split your user interface into independent, reusable chunks of code that allow for tweaking on an isolated level. Working together with components are the props and state which help determine how that component behaves. Compartmentalization at its best.

Exporting and importing form the basis of connectivity for these fragments of code and together with Redux, React is by far the most efficient and enjoyable programming tool I've encountered. Building on my foundation through the exploration of more app building in React is definitely my new priority.
