API or Scrape? A crucial decision to be made when embarking on the creation of a CLI Project.
I didn't want to take the chance that the website would change between the time that I started my project and when I would finish so I played it safe and chose to use an API.

My impression of the API is that while it is a safer route to navigate, it can still present the same volume of decision making challenges of Scraping. I need more fingers than I have to count the number of times I changed or thought about changing my API. I even went as far as to change my API the day before the deadline! Why? I found myself having to write too many lines of code on a then shorter deadline using my old API so changes beeded to be made.

Looking at video resource after resource, drafting my code by hand in a notebook duuring lunch at work, tapping into meetings to get any information that could help me, were the basic descriptions of project week(s) for me. I realised that I overthunk some things and definitely didn't think enough abut others.

Using a local environment to complete the project was BY FAR the best option for me. I was expecting to upgrade to IOS in the near future and was caught between project week arriving and me working on my Windows platform PC sans local environment. Coding in the Sandbox was not fun by any stretch of the imagination. Moving to IOS using a local environment setup was a saving grace and something I would advise any "on-the-fence" thinkers to move right along with.

I have now completed my project and it is ready for submission. I wait in anticipation to schedule my assessment and the ever more daunting task of having to explain hundreds of lines of code!

In any event, this journey is meant to be about learning and definitely about growing. Leaving my comfort zone was my aim and I can rest assured that I am no longer comfortable!

Happy Coding!
